## Understanding the role of inequality and power imbalance in natural resource management
### *Part of [ConFooBio](https://sti-cs.org/confoobio/)*

It is often thought that economic and social inequality negatively affects biodiversity conservation; however, few studies have actually tried to investigate or fully understand the nuances of such relationships.

In this project, I use <a href="https://confoobio.github.io/gmse/">GMSE</a>, an individual-based simulation framework and R package developed in ConFooBio, to better understand how inequality between (virtual) actors in a simulated socio-ecological system (in terms of e.g. extent of land ownership and/or financial “power”) may affect the conservation/sustainability of a natural resource.  

The simulations and analysis for this work are ongoing; I presented preliminary results at the BES Conference in December 2019 in Belfast, you can find the slides for this <a href="https://jejoenje.github.io/gmse_vary/pres/BES2019_JMinderman.html#1">here</a>.
