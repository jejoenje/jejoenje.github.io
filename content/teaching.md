## Teaching experience

I have extensive teaching experience at a range of levels (from undergraduate lectures to PhD student supervision) and in a range of forms (lectures, workshops, practicals and one-to-one training). I have both prepared new teaching materials as well as covered existing material.  
In addition to this, I have provided extensive help and support to a range of MSc and PhD stundents, particular for data analysis, modelling and technical aspects of a variety of work - this is something I am particularly keen on, and find particularly rewarding.

### Lectures & training courses

* Guest lecturer for undergraduate/MSc courses at Stirling University: Statistical Analysis Using R, Analysis of Environmental Data, and Environmental Costs of Energy Production, Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services (2013/14, 2019/20).  
For examples of recent lectures see [here](https://jejoenje.github.io/2020_ENMPG21/ENMPG21_2020_ModellingIntro.html#1) and [here](https://jejoenje.github.io/2020_ENMPG21/ENMPG21_2020_ModellingMSE.html#1).

* Contributing course facilitator for three-day professional course “Introduction to R for Biologists” run by [PR Statistics](https://bit.ly/2yJizTQ) (2015).

* Ungraduate teaching: sabattical leave cover for 2nd year Biodiversity module at University of Stirling (Vertebrate Biology): primary responsibility for planning and delivery of lectures, praticals & exams.

* Teaching Fellow at the [A.P. Leventis Ornithological Research Institute](https://aplori.org/), University of Jos, Nigeria (January 2014). Planned & facilitated two-week M.Sc. course of lectures and practicals in behavioural ecology & conservation biology.

### Student supervision (PhD, MSc & undergraduate)
    
* Co-supervisor on NERC CASE funded PhD project “Gulls and Garbage: the ecology, behaviour and physiology of a human-wildlife conflict”, based at the University of St Andrews.

* Co-supervisor on NERC/ESRC funded PhD project “Wildlife impacts of and public attitudes towards small wind turbines” (2012-2016), based at the University of Stirling.

* Primary or co-supervisor of 10 project students (postgraduate, MSc and undergraduates respectively) at the University of Stirling (2009-2020).
