## Interactive tools for applied natural resource management
### *Part of [ConFooBio](https://sti-cs.org/confoobio/)*

As part of ConFooBio I have had the opportunity to work on a number of short-term, externally funded, tendered contracts for third parties. Broadly speaking, this work has allowed me to work with stakeholders to develop better ways for non-specialists to interact with complex statistical and/or simulation models; 

For Nature.Scot, we **prepared a [report aimed at improving predictive models for the management of a population of Greenland barnacle geese on Islay](https://www.nature.scot/naturescot-research-report-1039-development-population-model-tool-predict-shooting-levels-greenland)**, which, although protected under international regulations, can cause extensive agricultural damage.
I developed the [online application](https://jejoenje.shinyapps.io/GooseGMSE/) (built using R Shiny) which allows the user to provide past field survey data, re-parameterise and run the underlying models, producing updated projections of goose population size, with appropriate uncertainties shown. 

For The Atlantic Salmon Trust, **I co-developed an [online app](https://jejoenje.shinyapps.io/salmonDST/) which will form the basis for a decision support tool for the management of different parts (spatially and temporally) of migratory Atlantic Salmon populations**. The app interactively links underlying models with management interventions, again allowing non-specialists to use and understand complex model inputs and outputs.
