<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a research scientist with over 11 years of experience working in the academic and commercial sectors.  

My entire career has been characterised by a strong quantitative and analytical element, with recent roles primarily focused on conservation science and ecology. I use statistical- and simulation modelling to analyse (often large) empirical datasets, and have built up extensive experience managing and formatting data for analysis, using tools including R, Python, C/C++, and SQL. Many of my previous roles focused on delivery of both [peer-reviewed papers](/publications#papers) as well as [reports](/publications#reports_chapters) to an excellent technical standard, as well as on actively pursuing stakeholder collaboration. I feel very strongly that science output, and in particular complex models, should be presented in interactive and accessible ways, and I have developed a number of [apps](publications#apps) that do so. 

I currently hold a Research Fellow position in the multidisciplinary [ConFooBio](https://sti-cs.org/confoobio/) research group, focusing on [developing novel ways to collect data on human decision-making in natural resource management using videogames (“gamesourcing”)](/projects#confoobio), and using such data to parameterise simulation models.

> *I am particularly interested in opportunities to apply my technical data science and analysis skills to practical, real-world problems.*
*This can be anything, from data management and organisation to complex statistical analysis and simulation models.* ***But I am especially passionate about work related to socio-ecological sustainability, and how creative ways of using data, as well as promoting data literacy, can support sustainability.***
